## ✨ **WHY THIS BOTY EXISTS**

Sometimes, life pulls us away work, travel, quiet days, or just needing space. But **love shouldn’t disappear**.  
This bot is my **digital hug machine** built for my friends (especially **Jenn**) to remind them:  
> *“You’re loved. You’re seen. You’re never forgotten.”*  
Even when I’m not around, this bot will be sending hugs, kisses, GIFs, and remind u how fabulous you are with messages custom on your schedule. 💕
